# Introduction to C# Graphics

This is an in-progress tutorial series on creating graphics, using OpenGL (via OpenTK), with C#.

In this series, I plan on walking through the basics through to more advanced features. This includes:
- Fixed Function pipeline
- 'Modern' graphics pipeline (programmable shaders)
- Potentially Vulkan (if I get around to learning it)


# Rationale

I've debated several way of delivering this material. I think I've settled in on using Github + Markdown as a way of delivering
simplified content, rather than going the route of some Blog posts. We'll see how that goes.
