# Documentation for the IntroToCSharpGraphics Github projects

This is an in-progress tutorial series on creating graphics, using OpenGL (via OpenTK), with C#.

Future documentation will be found here: https://nuclearfossil.github.io/IntroToCSharpGraphics/

In this series, I plan on walking through the basics through to more advanced features. This includes:
- Fixed Function pipeline
- 'Modern' graphics pipeline (programmable shaders)
- Potentially Vulkan (if I get around to learning it)
